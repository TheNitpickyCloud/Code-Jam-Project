# DESCRIPTION

You're a failed experiment, stuck in the deep depths of an abandoned lab. Your main goal at the moment is try to escape. Wait, did that screen just turn on?!
This will be your assistant. He will help you in your journey, but he is power hungry (literally). You will need to get power for him, so that he can use his power to help you!  
The assistant doesn't quite know why he's helping you, he just is. Maybe he lost his memory too?  

# Note: you will not be able to complete any level without the assistant  

# Block Info:  
Crate - A simple movable crate from left and right  
Lava Block - A dangerous, deadly block. Don't touch it! can be destroyed with Assistant Power.
